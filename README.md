## üîç Exploring the API & Search Demo

### 1. API Documentation (Swagger UI)
Once the application is running, interact with the full API specification via Swagger UI:
üëâ **[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)**

You can authenticate, retrieve a JWT token, and test all available endpoints for FAQ and user management in Postman.

### 2. Search Performance Demo
This project includes a dedicated page to visually compare the performance and results of the different search implementations.
üëâ **[http://localhost:8080/search.html](http://localhost:8080/search.html)**

Enter keywords and observe the response times and results from PostgreSQL and MongoDB with the Trie index and cached responses.
