## üöÄ Overview

**FAQ Service** is a high-performance, scalable, and secure backend service designed to power internal knowledge bases and employee onboarding experiences. This enterprise-grade solution enables organizations to centralize Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), drastically reducing onboarding time, improving information discoverability, and empowering employees with instant access to critical knowledge.

This MVP represents a robust foundation, featuring a modern microservices-style architecture, multiple search strategies for optimal performance, and a secure admin interface for content management. It is engineered for seamless integration into existing corporate infrastructure.

## üèó Architecture & Design

The service employs a clean, modular architecture:
*   **Layered Architecture:** Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) ensure separation of concerns.
*   **Custom Trie Implementation:** A novel in-memory search index built on a Trie data structure for lightning-fast prefix searches.
*   **Scheduled Sync Service:** A dedicated service synchronizes data between the primary SQL database and the various search engines (MongoDB, Trie, Cache).
*   **Global Exception Handling:** A unified exception handling mechanism provides consistent and informative API error responses.

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java 21
*   Maven 3.6+
*   Docker & Docker Compose (Recommended)
*   PostgreSQL 17+
*   MongoDB 7+
*   Redis

### Installation & Deployment

The easiest way to run the entire ecosystem is using Docker Compose.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd faq-service
    ```

2.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    This command will build the application and start all required databases.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    *The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.*

3.  **Manual Setup (Alternative):**
    *   Configure your databases and update the `application-Local.yml` file with your connection strings.
    *   Build and run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    java -jar target/faq-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=Local
    ```

## üîç Exploring the API & Search Demo

### 1. API Documentation (Swagger UI)
Once the application is running, interact with the full API specification via Swagger UI:
üëâ **[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)**

Here you can authenticate, retrieve a JWT token, and test all available endpoints for FAQ and user management.

### 2. Search Performance Demo
This project includes a dedicated page to visually compare the performance and results of the different search implementations.
üëâ **[http://localhost:8080/search.html](http://localhost:8080/search.html)**

Enter keywords and observe the response times and results from PostgreSQL, MongoDB, the Trie index, and cached responses.

---

## üìû Usage Example

1.  **Authenticate:** Use the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint to get a JWT token.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"admin", "password":"admin"}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login
    ```

2.  **Use the Token:** Include the received token in subsequent requests.
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/faqs
    ```

3.  **Create an FAQ:** Use the admin endpoint to populate the knowledge base.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "How do I request time off?", "answer": "Use the HR portal to submit a request."}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/faqs
    ```

4.  **Test Search:** Use the demo page or the API to search for keywords like "time" or "request".
